**Oxocarbon for Zed**
A dark and light theme for Zed inspired by the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/overview/#themes) and based on the Neovim oxocarbon theme.

The color palette is rooted in the same principles that define the IBM design system: a balance between humanity and technology, nature and machine. It features a vibrant set of blues, accompanied by industrial grays, all with a subtle digital glow. The oxocarbon palette harmonizes the blues across the spectrum, even adding hints of blue to the reds, creating a cohesive visual experience. The result is a design that embodies IBMâ€™s digital identity while remaining useful and aesthetically balanced.
